			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Is a Java Full-Stack Developer?
Web developers can specialize in front-end programming (user-facing programming), back-end programming (server-side programming), or both. When a web developer knows both front-end and back-end programming, this is called full-stack programming. 

So, a Java full-stack programmer is a developer who is trained in the Java programming language and technologies and knows both front-end and back-end development. 

What Does a Full-Stack Java Developer Do?
A full-stack Java developer is responsible for programming back-end code and software systems and designing the front-end areas of software or websites in the Java coding language. 

Full-stack Java developers often lead teams that work on software, websites, or applications. In some cases, they work on these things alone. 

7 Full-Stack Java Developer Skills
If you’re thinking of becoming a Java full-stack developer, some specific skills will serve you particularly well. We’ve made a list of seven full-stack Java developer skills. 

7 Full-Stack Java Developer Skills
If you’re thinking of becoming a Java full-stack developer, some specific skills will serve you particularly well. We’ve made a list of seven full-stack Java developer skills. 

1. HTML and CSS
Learning HTML and CSS is essential for any career path in web development.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) helps with creating web content and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a customization tool that helps with website design. 

HTML and CSS skills work together to help developers create functional and visually pleasing websites. 

2. Javascript
This one may be obvious, but it needs to be said! 

To be a Java full-stack developer, you need to know the Javascript coding language. It’s one of the most popular coding languages today, so knowing it can serve you well in many jobs and projects. 

In fact, Statista found that nearly 70% of developers used Javascript in the past 12 months.

Javascript is a front-end coding language – not to be confused with Java, which is a back-end coding language.

3. Git and GitHub
GitHub is a development platform where people can build and maintain software. It uses Git to provide Internet hosting, which is software that tracks changes within files. 

Both programs allow for easy web development, collaboration, and communication, especially within teams.

Git and GitHub are very different tools, so don’t get them confused! 

4. Web Architecture
Web architecture is the process of designing a website or program. Like a house, websites and programs need designing, planning, creating, and building to make an amazing final product. 

Web architecture takes the user’s experience into mind so that every project is functional, navigational, and informative for users.

5. Backend Languages
If you’re going to be a full-stack developer, you need to know back-end languages. 

There are many different back-end languages, and the more you know the more in demand you can be.

Consider learning multiple back-end coding languages, such as Ruby, PHP, Java, Net, and Python.

			Structured Query Language (SQL) (pronounced S-Q-L; historically "sequel")[4][5] is a domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system (RDBMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and variables.

Introduced in the 1970s, SQL offered two main advantages over older read–write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, i.e., with or without an index.

Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types of statements,[6] which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: Data query Language (DQL), Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Control Language (DCL), and Data Manipulation Language (DML).[7]

The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update, and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control. Although SQL is essentially a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.

SQL was one of the first commercial languages to use Edgar F. Codd's relational model. The model was described in his influential 1970 paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks".[8] Despite not entirely adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, SQL became the most widely used database language.[9][10]

SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986 and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.[11] Since then, the standard has been revised multiple times to include a larger set of features and incorporate common extensions. Despite the existence of standards, virtually no implementations in existence adhere to it fully, and most SQL code requires at least some changes before being ported to different database systems.

History
SQL was initially developed at IBM by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce after learning about the relational model from Edgar F. Codd[12] in the early 1970s.[13] This version, initially called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM's original quasirelational database management system, System R, which a group at IBM San Jose Research Laboratory had developed during the 1970s.[13]

Chamberlin and Boyce's first attempt at a relational database language was SQUARE (Specifying Queries in A Relational Environment), but it was difficult to use due to subscript/superscript notation. After moving to the San Jose Research Laboratory in 1973, they began work on a sequel to SQUARE.[12] The original name SEQUEL, which is widely regarded as a pun on QUEL, the query language of Ingres,[14] was later changed to SQL (dropping the vowels) because "SEQUEL" was a trademark of the UK-based Hawker Siddeley Dynamics Engineering Limited company.[15] The label SQL later became the acronym for Structured Query Language.

After testing SQL at customer test sites to determine the usefulness and practicality of the system, IBM began developing commercial products based on their System R prototype, including System/38, SQL/DS, and IBM Db2, which were commercially available in 1979, 1981, and 1983, respectively.[16]

In the late 1970s, Relational Software, Inc. (now Oracle Corporation) saw the potential of the concepts described by Codd, Chamberlin, and Boyce, and developed their own SQL-based RDBMS with aspirations of selling it to the U.S. Navy, Central Intelligence Agency, and other U.S. government agencies. In June 1979, Relational Software introduced one of the first commercially available implementations of SQL, Oracle V2 (Version2) for VAX computers.

By 1986, ANSI and ISO standard groups officially adopted the standard "Database Language SQL" language definition. New versions of the standard were published in 1989, 1992, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2011,[12] 2016 and most recently, 2023.[17]
